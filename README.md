# Project Architecture

## Overview

The task management app is designed to help users organize and track their tasks efficiently. It provides features such as task creation, assignment, status tracking, and deadline management.

## Technologies Used

The task management app is built using the following technologies and frameworks:

- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
- Back-end: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB

## Directory Structure

The project follows the following directory structure:

- `src`: Contains the source code for the front-end and back-end.
- `public`: Contains static assets and the main HTML file.
- `server`: Contains the server-side code.
- `client`: Contains the client-side code.

## Components

The main components of the task management app include:

- User Interface: Responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions.
- Server: Handles API requests, performs business logic, and interacts with the database.
- Database: Stores task data and user information.

## Data Flow

The data flow within the task management app is as follows:

1. The user interacts with the user interface, triggering events.
2. The user interface sends requests to the server via APIs.
3. The server processes the requests, performs necessary operations, and interacts with the database.
4. The server sends back the response to the user interface, which updates the UI accordingly.

## Deployment

The task management app can be deployed on a server or cloud platform such as Heroku or AWS. It requires Node.js and MongoDB to be installed and configured.

## Development Setup

To set up the development environment and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the server: `npm run server`
4. Start the client: `npm run client`
5. Access the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## Testing

The task management app follows a comprehensive testing strategy. Unit tests are written using frameworks such as Jest and Enzyme for both the front-end and back-end components. Integration tests are performed to ensure the smooth interaction between different components.

## Continuous Integration/Deployment

The project uses a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building, and deployment processes. Whenever changes are pushed to the repository, the pipeline runs tests, builds the project, and deploys it to a staging or production environment.

## Documentation

Additional documentation and resources related to the project can be found in the `docs` directory of the repository.
